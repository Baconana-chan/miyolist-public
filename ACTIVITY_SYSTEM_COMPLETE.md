## Features Implemented

- `postActivityReply({activityId, text, replyId?})` → Returns reply data

## Bug Fixes

### 1. Windows Push Notification Error ✅
**Problem:** `UnimplementedError: zonedSchedule() has not been implemented`

**Solution:**
- Added platform detection in `PushNotificationService`
- Windows now shows notifications immediately instead of scheduling
- Android/Linux continue to use `zonedSchedule()`
- Warning log for future scheduled notifications on Windows

**Code:**
```dart
if (Platform.isWindows) {
  // Show immediately if time has passed
  if (scheduledDate.isBefore(now) || scheduledDate.difference(now).inMinutes < 1) {
    await _notifications.show(...);
  } else {
    print('⚠️ Windows does not support scheduled notifications.');
  }
} else {
  // Android/Linux use zonedSchedule
  await _notifications.zonedSchedule(...);
}
```

### 2. Multiple API Requests on App Start ✅
**Problem:** Multiple "Initializing AniList GraphQL client" logs

**Solution:**
- Moved "Initializing..." log AFTER the initialization check
- Now only logs when actually initializing (not on every call)
- Removed redundant "Ensuring..." log from `fetchCurrentUser()`

**Before:**
```
🔧 Ensuring AniList client is initialized...
🔧 Initializing AniList GraphQL client...
✅ Access token found
✅ AniList GraphQL client initialized
```

**After:**
```
🔧 Initializing AniList GraphQL client...
✅ Access token found
✅ AniList GraphQL client initialized
```
(Only shows once, not on every subsequent call)
