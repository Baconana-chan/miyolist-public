# 🎉 Introducing MiyoList v1.0.0 "Aoi" - Unofficial AniList Desktop Client

**Hey AniList community!** 👋

I'm excited to share **MiyoList v1.0.0 "Aoi (葵)"** - an unofficial desktop client for AniList built with Flutter!

---

## 🌟 What is MiyoList?

MiyoList is a **Windows desktop application** that connects to your AniList account and provides a beautiful, fast, and privacy-focused way to track your anime and manga. Think of it as a native desktop companion to the AniList website.

**Why "Aoi"?** The name means "hollyhock" or "blue" in Japanese, symbolizing new beginnings. This is the official v1.0.0 release after months of development!

## ✨ Key Features

### 📚 **Better List Management**
*[Screenshot 1: Anime List with Grid View showing color-coded status indicators]*

Look at those beautiful **color-coded status strips**:
- 🟢 Green = Currently Watching
- 🔵 Blue = Planning
- 🟣 Purple = Completed
- 🟠 Orange = Paused
- 🔴 Red = Dropped
- 🔵 Cyan = Repeating

**Why this matters:** You can see your ENTIRE list at a glance with the "All" status filter - no more clicking through tabs! The website makes you switch between status tabs, but MiyoList shows everything in one beautiful grid.

### ⚡ **Bulk Operations - HUGE Time Saver!**
*[Screenshot 2: Bulk select mode with multiple anime selected (blue borders and checkmarks)]*

This is my favorite feature: **edit multiple anime at once!**

Long-press any anime to enter multi-select mode, then:
- ✅ Change status for 10 anime at once
- ⭐ Update scores in bulk
- 🗑️ Delete multiple entries
- 📦 Select all for mass updates

**This feature does NOT exist on the AniList website!** If you have a large list and need to clean it up or update multiple entries, this is a massive time saver.

---

### 🔍 **Advanced Search & Discovery**
*[Screenshot 3: Advanced Search dialog with filters (genre, year, season, format, status)]*

Search with **multiple filters** in one dialog:
- 🎭 Genre filter (multiple selection)
- 📅 Year & Season filter
- 📺 Format (TV, Movie, OVA, etc.)
- ⭐ Score range
- 📊 Episode/chapter count
- 🔥 Sort by popularity, score, trending, or alphabetical

**Why better:** All filters in ONE place! On the website, you have to navigate multiple dropdowns and pages. Here, it's instant.

---

### 🏠 **Activity Hub - Your Anime Dashboard**
*[Screenshot 4: Activity page showing "Airing Today", Trending, and Newly Added sections]*

The **Activity page** is your anime command center:
- 📺 **"Airing Today"** at the top showing YOUR watching anime with episode countdowns
- 🔥 **Trending Anime & Manga** sections
- 🆕 **Newly Added** content for discovery
- 🎨 **Color-coded cards** (Blue for anime, Red for manga, Purple/Orange for new)

**Why better:** Everything in ONE dashboard! No need to navigate between "Airing", "Browse", and "Activity" pages like on the website.

---

### 📅 **Personal Airing Schedule**
*[Screenshot 5: Airing Schedule showing 7-day view with episode countdowns]*

Your **personal airing calendar** showing only what YOU'RE watching:
- ⏱️ **Real-time countdowns** (e.g., "In 2h 15m" or "Aired 3h ago")
- 📅 **7-day schedule** organized by day
- 🔔 **Quick notification toggle** per anime
- 🎯 **Focused view** - no clutter from anime you're not watching

**Why better:** Unlike AniChart which shows ALL airing anime, this shows only YOUR list. Much more focused!

---

### 📖 **Complete Media Details**
*[Screenshot 6: Media Details page with banner, cover, description, characters, staff, relations]*

All information in **one scrollable page**:
- 🖼️ Beautiful banner image
- 📝 Full description with HTML formatting
- 👥 Characters with voice actors
- 🎬 Staff with roles
- 🏢 Studios (clickable)
- 🔗 Relations (sequels, prequels, side stories)
- ⭐ Statistics (score, popularity, ranking)
- 🌐 External links

**Why better:** No clicking through multiple tabs! Everything is right there as you scroll.

---

### 🎨 **Beautiful Themes**
*[Screenshot 7: Theme selector showing Dark, Light, and Carrot themes]*

Choose your style:
- 🌙 **Dark Theme** (default)
- ☀️ **Light Theme**
- 🥕 **Carrot Theme** (unique orange aesthetic!)

The **Carrot theme** is exclusive to MiyoList - you won't find it anywhere else! 🥕

---

### 🔒 **Privacy & Offline Support**
*[Screenshot 8: Privacy Settings dialog showing profile types and selective sync]*

**Your data, your choice:**
- 🔐 **Private Profile:** Everything stays on your device (no cloud sync)
- ☁️ **Public Profile:** Enable cloud sync with selective controls
- 📑 **Tab Visibility:** Hide anime/manga/novels tabs you don't use
- 💾 **Offline-first:** Works without internet!

**Why better:** Complete control over what syncs to the cloud. The website always syncs everything - here, YOU decide.
