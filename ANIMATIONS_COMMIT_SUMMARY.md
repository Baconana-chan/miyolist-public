## 🎯 Animation Architecture

### Controller Setup
```dart
// Mixin change
with TickerProviderStateMixin

// Controller
_chartAnimationController = AnimationController(
  vsync: this,
  duration: Duration(milliseconds: 800),
);

// Animation with curve
_chartAnimation = CurvedAnimation(
  parent: _chartAnimationController,
  curve: Curves.easeInOutCubic,
);
```

### Triggers
1. **Initial Load**: `_chartAnimationController.forward(from: 0.0)`
2. **Tab Change**: Listener on `_tabController`
3. **Data Update**: Automatic via `_loadStatistics()`
4. **View Toggle**: Automatic via `setState()`

### Disposal
- Properly disposed in `dispose()` method
- No memory leaks

## 🎨 Animation Curves Used

1. **easeInOutCubic** (Charts, Cards)
   - Smooth acceleration and deceleration
   - Professional feel
   - Duration: 800ms

2. **easeInOut** (Buttons, Toggle)
   - Quick transitions
   - Clean feel
   - Duration: 200ms

3. **easeOut** (Heatmap stagger)
   - Fast start, gentle landing
   - Wave effect
   - Duration: 600ms + stagger
