#### Timeline Charts
- [ ] Go to Timeline tab
- [ ] **Monthly View**:
  - [ ] Line should draw smoothly from left to right
  - [ ] Dots should appear progressively
  - [ ] Gradient fill should animate underneath
- [ ] Click **Yearly** button:
  - [ ] Smooth transition animation (200ms)

### 3. Interactive Element Tests

#### Period Filter Buttons
- [ ] Click "7 days" ‚Üí Smooth color transition
- [ ] Click "30 days" ‚Üí Background animates to blue
- [ ] Click "90 days" ‚Üí Previous selection fades out
- [ ] Click "1 year" ‚Üí Smooth transitions throughout

**Expected**: 200ms color transitions, no flicker

#### Timeline Toggle Button
- [ ] Click "Monthly" ‚Üí Background color shifts smoothly
- [ ] Click "Yearly" ‚Üí Text and background animate together
- [ ] No jarring color changes

**Expected**: Synchronized color + text animations

### 4. Performance Tests

#### Desktop Performance
- [ ] Open Statistics with large list (100+ anime)
- [ ] Switch tabs rapidly (5-6 switches)
- [ ] Check Task Manager ‚Üí CPU should stay under 10%
- [ ] Animations should remain 60 FPS

**Expected**: Smooth performance, no lag

#### Heatmap Stress Test
- [ ] Go to Activity tab with 365-day heatmap
- [ ] Observe animation performance
- [ ] Hover over multiple cells quickly
- [ ] Scroll horizontally during animation

**Expected**: Stable 60 FPS, no frame drops

---

### 5. Edge Case Tests

#### Empty Data
- [ ] Fresh install with no anime/manga
- [ ] Open Statistics page
- [ ] Empty state messages should appear smoothly
- [ ] No animation errors

**Expected**: Graceful empty state handling

#### Data Changes
- [ ] Add new anime while on Statistics page
- [ ] Switch period filters
- [ ] Animations should restart correctly
- [ ] No data corruption during animation

**Expected**: Smooth data transitions

#### Rapid Interactions
- [ ] Switch tabs rapidly (spam clicking)
- [ ] Change periods quickly (5+ clicks in 2 seconds)
- [ ] Toggle timeline view repeatedly

**Expected**: No animation conflicts, smooth queue handling

---

### 6. Visual Quality Tests

#### Animation Smoothness
- [ ] All animations use smooth curves (no linear motion)
- [ ] No sudden jumps or jerks
- [ ] Consistent timing across all charts

**Expected**: Professional, polished feel

#### Tooltip Timing
- [ ] Tooltips appear without delay
- [ ] Tooltips work during animations
- [ ] No tooltip flickering

**Expected**: Instant, reliable tooltips

#### Color Transitions
- [ ] Period filter button colors blend smoothly
- [ ] Heatmap cells don't flicker
- [ ] No color banding

**Expected**: Smooth gradients and transitions

## üêõ Known Issues to Watch For

### Potential Issues
1. **Heatmap Performance**: On low-end devices, 365 cells might lag
   - ‚úÖ **Mitigated**: Staggered delays reduce simultaneous animations
   
2. **Memory Leaks**: AnimationController not disposed
   - ‚úÖ **Fixed**: `dispose()` properly called
   
3. **Animation Conflicts**: Rapid tab switching
   - ‚úÖ **Fixed**: Animation restarts from 0 on tab change
