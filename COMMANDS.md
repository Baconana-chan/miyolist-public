## Code Generation Tips

### When to Run build_runner
- After creating/modifying models with `@HiveType`
- After adding/removing `@HiveField` annotations
- After any changes to files with `part '*.g.dart'`
- When you see "Target of URI hasn't been generated" errors

### Watch Mode Benefits
- Automatically generates files on save
- No need to manually run build_runner
- Great for development
- Use: `flutter pub run build_runner watch`

## Quick Fixes

### Problem: "Target of URI not found"
```bash
flutter pub run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs
```

### Problem: "Package not found"
```bash
flutter clean
flutter pub get
```

### Problem: "Build failed"
```bash
flutter clean
flutter pub get
flutter pub run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs
flutter run
```

### Problem: "Plugin not registered"
```bash
flutter clean
flutter pub get
```

## Useful Aliases (Optional)

Add these to your shell profile (.bashrc, .zshrc, etc.):

```bash
alias frun='flutter run'
alias fbuild='flutter build'
alias fclean='flutter clean && flutter pub get'
alias fgen='flutter pub run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs'
alias ftest='flutter test'
alias fanalyze='flutter analyze'
alias fformat='flutter format .'
```

Then you can use:
```bash
fgen  # Instead of flutter pub run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs
frun  # Instead of flutter run
```

## Remember

1. **Always** run build_runner after model changes
2. **Always** flutter clean when things get weird
3. **Always** flutter pub get after adding dependencies
4. **Save often** to use hot reload
5. **Check logs** when errors occur
