## 🐛 Bugs Fixed

### 1. Time-ago Package Issue
**Problem:** `timeago` package not available  
**Solution:** Implemented custom `_formatTimeAgo(DateTime)` method  
**Result:** Time formatting works without external dependency

### 2. AniList Client Access
**Problem:** SocialService couldn't access GraphQL client  
**Solution:** Added public `client` getter to AniListService  
**Result:** SocialService can now make queries

### 3. Syntax Error in ProfilePage
**Problem:** Too many closing brackets causing compilation error  
**Solution:** Changed `)` to `]` on line 568  
**Result:** 0 compilation errors

### 4. Tab Count Mismatch
**Problem:** TabController(length: 3) but 4 tabs needed  
**Solution:** Changed length to 4, added _buildFollowingTab() method  
**Result:** 4-tab structure works correctly
