# GitHub Actions CI/CD Implementation

**Date:** October 16, 2025  
**Type:** DevOps Enhancement  
**Status:** ✅ Complete

---

## 📋 Summary

Implemented automated build system using GitHub Actions for Linux and macOS platforms, enabling cross-platform releases without local builds.

---

## ✨ What Was Added

### 1. **CI Build Workflow** (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`)
Continuous Integration workflow that runs on every push to `main` or `develop` branches.

**Features:**
- ✅ Automated Linux build testing on Ubuntu
- ✅ Automated macOS build testing on macOS
- ✅ Code quality checks (formatting, analysis)
- ✅ Unit test execution with coverage
- ✅ Artifact upload (7 days retention)

**Triggers:**
- Push to `main` or `develop` branches
- Pull requests to `main` or `develop`

---

### 2. **Release Build Workflow** (`.github/workflows/build-release.yml`)
Production release workflow that builds and publishes binaries.

**Features:**
- ✅ Linux x64 build (tar.gz)
- ✅ macOS Universal build (DMG with app icon)
- ✅ Automatic GitHub Release creation
- ✅ Binary artifact upload (90 days retention)
- ✅ Release notes generation

**Triggers:**
- Git tags matching `v*.*.*` (e.g., `v1.0.2`)
- Manual workflow dispatch

---

### 3. **Documentation**

#### Main Documentation (`.github/workflows/README.md`)
Comprehensive guide covering:
- Workflow descriptions
- Usage instructions
- Troubleshooting
- CI/CD pipeline diagram
- Version management

#### Quick Start Guide (`GITHUB_ACTIONS.md`)
Quick reference for:
- Permission setup
- Release creation
- Artifact download
- Common commands

#### Updated README.md
- Added Linux and macOS to supported platforms
- Added CI badge
- Added installation instructions for Linux/macOS
- Added link to GitHub Actions documentation

```

### GitHub Actions Used
- `actions/checkout@v4` - Repository checkout
- `subosito/flutter-action@v2` - Flutter SDK setup
- `actions/upload-artifact@v4` - Artifact upload
- `actions/download-artifact@v4` - Artifact download
- `softprops/action-gh-release@v1` - Release creation
- `codecov/codecov-action@v3` - Code coverage (optional)

## 📦 Build Process

### Linux Build
```yaml
1. Checkout repository
2. Setup Flutter SDK (3.35.5)
3. Install system dependencies (GTK, etc.)
4. Get Flutter dependencies
5. Enable Linux desktop
6. Build release binary
7. Create tar.gz archive
8. Upload artifact
```

### macOS Build
```yaml
1. Checkout repository
2. Setup Flutter SDK (3.35.5)
3. Get Flutter dependencies
4. Enable macOS desktop
5. Build release binary
6. Create DMG with app icon
7. Upload artifact
```

### Release Creation
```yaml
1. Download Linux artifact
2. Download macOS artifact
3. Extract version from tag
4. Create GitHub Release
5. Upload binaries
6. Generate release notes
```

## 🔐 Required Permissions

### Repository Settings
Go to **Settings** → **Actions** → **General**:
- ✅ Workflow permissions: **Read and write**
- ✅ Allow GitHub Actions to create releases

### Token Permissions
`GITHUB_TOKEN` automatically provided with:
- `contents: write` - Create releases
- `actions: read` - Download artifacts

---

## 🚀 Usage

### Automatic Release (Recommended)
```bash
# 1. Update version
vim pubspec.yaml  # Change version: 1.0.2+2

# 2. Commit
git add pubspec.yaml
git commit -m "chore: bump version to 1.0.2"
git push

# 3. Create tag
git tag v1.0.2
git push origin v1.0.2

# 4. GitHub Actions builds automatically
```

### Manual Release
1. Go to **Actions** → **Build Release**
2. Click **Run workflow**
3. Enter version (e.g., `1.0.2`)
4. Click **Run workflow**

## 🐛 Known Limitations

1. **macOS App Not Signed**
   - Users must manually approve on first launch
   - Requires developer account for signing ($99/year)

2. **Linux Distribution**
   - Built on Ubuntu 20.04
   - May require GTK 3.0+ on target system

3. **Windows & Android**
   - Still require local builds
   - Future: Could add Windows build to workflow

## 🔮 Future Improvements

- [ ] Add Windows build to GitHub Actions
- [ ] Add Android build to GitHub Actions (requires keystore)
- [ ] Add iOS build (requires macOS with Xcode)
- [ ] Code signing for macOS (requires Apple Developer account)
- [ ] Notarization for macOS
- [ ] Automated changelog generation
- [ ] Integration tests
- [ ] Performance benchmarks
- [ ] Multi-architecture builds (ARM64)
