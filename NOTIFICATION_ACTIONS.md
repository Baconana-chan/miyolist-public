---

## 🔧 Implementation

### 1. Action Buttons in Notifications

**Modified:** `scheduleNotification()` method

Added `actions` parameter to `AndroidNotificationDetails`:

```dart
actions: includeActions && payload != null && payload.startsWith('anime:')
    ? [
        const AndroidNotificationAction(
          'mark_watched',
          '✅ Mark as Watched',
          showsUserInterface: false,
        ),
        const AndroidNotificationAction(
          'snooze_30',
          '⏰ Snooze 30min',
          showsUserInterface: false,
        ),
        const AndroidNotificationAction(
          'snooze_60',
          '⏰ Snooze 1hr',
          showsUserInterface: false,
        ),
      ]
    : null,
```

**Features:**
- Only shown for episode notifications (`anime:` payload)
- `showsUserInterface: false` - Actions execute in background
- Doesn't require opening the app

---

### 2. Action Handler

**New Method:** `_handleNotificationAction(String actionId, String? payload)`

Processes action button clicks:

```dart
Future<void> _handleNotificationAction(String actionId, String? payload) async {
  if (payload == null) return;

  try {
    // Parse payload: "anime:mediaId:episode"
    final parts = payload.split(':');
    if (parts.length < 3 || parts[0] != 'anime') return;

    final mediaId = int.parse(parts[1]);
    final episode = int.parse(parts[2]);

    if (actionId == 'mark_watched') {
      // Mark episode as watched
      await _markEpisodeAsWatched(mediaId, episode);
    } else if (actionId.startsWith('snooze_')) {
      // Snooze notification
      final minutes = int.parse(actionId.split('_')[1]);
      await _snoozeNotification(mediaId, episode, minutes);
    }
  } catch (e) {
    print('❌ Error handling notification action: $e');
  }
}
```

**Payload Format:** `anime:mediaId:episode`
- Example: `anime:12345:5` (Anime #12345, Episode 5)

---

### 3. Mark as Watched Implementation

**New Method:** `_markEpisodeAsWatched(int mediaId, int episode)`

Updates episode progress via callback:

```dart
Future<void> _markEpisodeAsWatched(int mediaId, int episode) async {
  try {
    if (onMarkEpisodeWatched != null) {
      // Use callback to update via AniListService
      await onMarkEpisodeWatched!(mediaId, episode);
      
      // Show confirmation
      await showActivityNotification(
        title: '✅ Episode Marked as Watched',
        message: 'Episode $episode has been updated on AniList',
      );
    } else {
      // Fallback if callback not set
      await showActivityNotification(
        title: 'ℹ️ Action Registered',
        message: 'Episode $episode marked (sync pending)',
      );
    }
  } catch (e) {
    print('❌ Error marking episode as watched: $e');
    await showActivityNotification(
      title: '❌ Error',
      message: 'Failed to mark episode as watched',
    );
  }
}
```

**Callback System:**
- `onMarkEpisodeWatched` - Function pointer set in `main.dart`
- Integrates with `AniListService` for real API updates
- Graceful fallback if callback not set

---

### 4. Snooze Implementation

**New Method:** `_snoozeNotification(int mediaId, int episode, int minutes)`

Reschedules notification:

```dart
Future<void> _snoozeNotification(int mediaId, int episode, int minutes) async {
  try {
    final snoozeTime = DateTime.now().add(Duration(minutes: minutes));
    
    // Get anime title (ideally from cache)
    final animeTitle = 'Anime #$mediaId'; // TODO: Get real title
    
    // Schedule new notification
    await scheduleNotification(
      id: mediaId + episode * 100000,
      title: '📺 New Episode Available (Reminder)',
      message: 'Episode $episode of $animeTitle is ready to watch',
      scheduledDate: snoozeTime,
      payload: 'anime:$mediaId:$episode',
    );
    
    // Show confirmation
    await showActivityNotification(
      title: '⏰ Notification Snoozed',
      message: 'Reminder set for ${minutes}min from now',
    );
    
    print('✅ Notification snoozed for $minutes minutes');
  } catch (e) {
    print('❌ Error snoozing notification: $e');
  }
}
```

**Features:**
- Cancels old notification (same ID)
- Creates new notification at future time
- Preserves all notification details
- Confirmation notification

---

### 5. Callback Integration in main.dart

**Added:** AniListService callback setup

```dart
// Initialize push notification service and set up callback
final pushService = PushNotificationService();
await pushService.initialize();

// Set up callback for marking episodes as watched
final authService = AuthService();
final anilistService = AniListService(authService);
pushService.onMarkEpisodeWatched = (int mediaId, int episode) async {
  try {
    // Update progress via AniList
    await anilistService.updateMediaListEntry(
      mediaId: mediaId,
      progress: episode,
    );
    print('✅ Episode $episode marked as watched for anime $mediaId');
  } catch (e) {
    print('❌ Error updating episode progress: $e');
    rethrow;
  }
};
```

**Benefits:**
- Real AniList API integration
- Decoupled architecture (callback pattern)
- Testable (can mock callback)
