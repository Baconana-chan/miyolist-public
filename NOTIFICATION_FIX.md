# Notification System Fix (v1.1.0-dev)

## Overview
Fixed critical errors in notification system related to new AniList notification types (forum thread likes and direct messages).

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ‚ùå Type Cast Error: `type 'Null' is not a subtype of type 'int' in type cast`

**Root Cause:**
- `createdAt` field in GraphQL response could be `null` for some notification types
- Code was forcefully casting to `int` without null check: `(json['createdAt'] as int)`

**Solution:**
Added safe parsing in `AniListNotification.fromJson()`:
```dart
// Safe parsing of createdAt - handle both int and null
DateTime createdAt;
final createdAtValue = json['createdAt'];
if (createdAtValue != null) {
  createdAt = DateTime.fromMillisecondsSinceEpoch(
    (createdAtValue as int) * 1000,
  );
} else {
  createdAt = DateTime.now(); // Fallback to current time
}
```

### 2. ‚ùå Missing Notification Type: `THREAD_LIKE`

**Problem:**
- New notification type from AniList: when someone likes your forum thread
- Example: "or353 liked your forum thread, MiyoList: AL app for Windows and Android"
- GraphQL query didn't include `ThreadLikeNotification` fragment
- No case handling in model methods

**Solution:**
- Added `ThreadLikeNotification` fragment to GraphQL query in `notification_service.dart`:
```graphql
... on ThreadLikeNotification {
  id
  type
  context
  createdAt
  thread {
    id
    title
  }
  user {
    id
    name
    avatar {
      large
    }
  }
}
```

- Added case handling in `notification.dart`:
  - `getTypeIcon()`: Returns 'üí¨' for `THREAD_LIKE`
  - `getTypeName()`: Returns 'Forum' for `THREAD_LIKE`
  - `getFormattedText()`: Returns `"${userName ?? 'Someone'} liked your forum thread${threadTitle != null ? ', $threadTitle' : ''}."`

### 3. ‚ùå Missing User Name in Messages: `ACTIVITY_MESSAGE`

**Problem:**
- Activity messages showed: "das sent you a message."
- But username was not properly displayed, showing incomplete text
- `ACTIVITY_MESSAGE` type was already in GraphQL but not handled in model

**Solution:**
- Added `ACTIVITY_MESSAGE` to all switch cases in `notification.dart`:
  - `getTypeIcon()`: Returns '‚ù§Ô∏è' (grouped with activity types)
  - `getTypeName()`: Returns 'Activity'
  - `getFormattedText()`: Returns `"${userName ?? 'Someone'} sent you a message."`

## Files Modified

### `lib/core/services/notification_service.dart`
- **Line ~233**: Added `ThreadLikeNotification` GraphQL fragment
- Ensures forum thread likes are properly fetched from AniList API

### `lib/core/models/notification.dart`
- **Lines 48-62**: Rewrote `fromJson()` with safe `createdAt` parsing
- **Lines 120-139**: Added `ACTIVITY_MESSAGE` and `THREAD_LIKE` to `getTypeIcon()`
- **Lines 143-166**: Added `ACTIVITY_MESSAGE` and `THREAD_LIKE` to `getTypeName()`
- **Lines 170-204**: Added `ACTIVITY_MESSAGE` and `THREAD_LIKE` to `getFormattedText()`

## Testing Recommendations

### Test Case 1: Forum Thread Like
1. Create a forum thread on AniList
2. Have someone like your thread
3. Check notifications in MiyoList
4. ‚úÖ Should display: "username liked your forum thread, Thread Title."
5. ‚úÖ Should show forum icon (üí¨)
6. ‚úÖ Clicking should open thread URL

### Test Case 2: Activity Message
1. Have someone send you a direct message on AniList
2. Check notifications in MiyoList
3. ‚úÖ Should display: "username sent you a message."
4. ‚úÖ Should show activity icon (‚ù§Ô∏è)
5. ‚úÖ Username should be visible (not null)

### Test Case 3: Null createdAt Handling
1. Fetch notifications with various types
2. ‚úÖ No type cast errors should occur
3. ‚úÖ All notifications should have valid timestamps
4. ‚úÖ Fallback to current time if createdAt is null
