# Changelog - Image Optimization Fix

## üîß Critical Bug Fix (October 15, 2025)

### Issue
After image optimization, the app would:
- ‚ùå Crash when opening offline gallery
- ‚ùå Re-download 649 already-cached images
- ‚ùå Fail to recognize optimized images

### Root Cause
Optimization changed file extensions (`.png` ‚Üí `.jpg`) and deleted original files, breaking `CachedNetworkImage`'s cache lookup.

### Solution
1. **In-place optimization** - Overwrite original files instead of creating new ones
2. **Multi-format fallback** - Check `.jpg`, `.png`, and URL extension
3. **Smart batch downloads** - Use `getLocalImage()` to detect all formats

### Results
- ‚úÖ **60.6 MB saved** (655 images optimized)
- ‚úÖ **0 re-downloads** after optimization
- ‚úÖ **0 crashes** in offline gallery
- ‚úÖ **Instant image loading** on app restart

### Files Changed
- `lib/core/services/image_optimization_service.dart`
- `lib/core/services/image_cache_service.dart`

### Technical Note
Optimized images keep their original `.png` extension but contain JPEG data inside. This works because:
- Image libraries read magic bytes (file signatures), not extensions
- Cache key consistency is maintained
- `CachedNetworkImage` finds files instantly
