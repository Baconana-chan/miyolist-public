## 🎉 MiyoList v1.0.0 "Aoi (葵)" - Official Release

Hi r/anime! After months of development, I'm excited to share **MiyoList** - an unofficial desktop client for AniList built with Flutter.

### What is it?

A **Windows desktop application** that connects to your AniList account and provides a faster, more visual way to manage your anime and manga lists.

### Why I built it

I have 2000+ anime in my list and managing them on the website was painful:
- Clicking through status tabs one by one
- No way to edit multiple entries at once
- Slow page loads in browser
- Can't work offline

So I built MiyoList to solve these problems.

### Key Features

**1. Bulk Operations (Website doesn't have this!)**
- Long-press to select multiple anime
- Change status for 10+ entries at once
- Update scores in bulk
- Mass delete

**2. Better Visual Organization**
- Color-coded status strips (Green=Watching, Blue=Planning, Purple=Completed, etc.)
- Grid view with covers
- "All" filter to see entire list at once
- No clicking through tabs!

**3. Offline Support**
- Works without internet
- Local-first architecture
- Sync when you want

**4. Personal Airing Schedule**
- Shows only YOUR watching anime
- Real-time episode countdowns
- Quick notification toggle
- More focused than AniChart

**5. Privacy Control**
- Private profile mode (local-only)
- Selective cloud sync
- You choose what syncs

**6. Themes**
- Dark, Light, and exclusive "Carrot" theme 🥕

### Screenshots

[Imgur album with 8-10 screenshots showing features]

1. Activity Hub - All your anime info in one place
2. Color-coded List - Visual status indicators
3. Bulk Operations - Multi-select mode

5. Airing Schedule - Personal 7-day view
6. Media Details - Complete info, one page
7. Themes - Dark, Light, Carrot
8. Privacy Settings - Full control

2. Extract ZIP

- **Local database:** Hive (offline-first)
