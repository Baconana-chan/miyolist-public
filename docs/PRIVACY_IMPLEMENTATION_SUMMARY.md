## ✅ Feature Complete

The privacy profile selection feature has been successfully implemented! Users can now choose between **Private** (local-only) and **Public** (cloud-synced) profiles.

---

## 📋 What Was Added

### 1. New Model: UserSettings

**File:** `lib/core/models/user_settings.dart`

```dart
@HiveType(typeId: 3)
class UserSettings extends HiveObject {
  @HiveField(0) final bool isPublicProfile;
  @HiveField(1) final bool enableCloudSync;
  @HiveField(2) final bool enableSocialFeatures;
  @HiveField(3) final DateTime createdAt;
  @HiveField(4) final DateTime updatedAt;
  
  // Factory constructors for default settings
  factory UserSettings.defaultPrivate();
  factory UserSettings.defaultPublic();
}
```

**Purpose:** Store user privacy preferences
**Storage:** Hive box named `settings_box`
**Generated:** `user_settings.g.dart` adapter created via build_runner

### 2. Profile Type Selection Page

**File:** `lib/features/auth/presentation/pages/profile_type_selection_page.dart`

**Features:**
- Two-card selection UI (Private vs Public)

3. `ProfileTypeSelectionPage` appears

UserSettings? getUserSettings()
bool isPublicProfile()
bool isCloudSyncEnabled()
```

**New Box:** `settings_box` registered for UserSettings
