**Target Release:** v1.1.0 "Botan (Áâ°‰∏π)"

---

## üéØ Release Strategy

### Version Naming Convention
Starting with v1.0.0, MiyoList uses **named versions** instead of standard semantic versioning:
- **v1.0.0 "Aoi (Ëëµ)"** - Official release (Blue/Hollyhock - symbolizing new beginnings) ‚úÖ
- **v1.0.1** - Minor patch (Adult content filtering, Quick episode marking) ‚úÖ
- **v1.1.0 "Botan (Áâ°‰∏π)"** - Charts & Activity History (Green - growth and progress)
- **v1.x.x-dev** - Development versions
- Future major releases will follow this naming pattern with meaningful Japanese names

### Path to v1.0.0 "Aoi"
This TODO is structured to guide development towards **v1.0.0 "Aoi (Ëëµ)" official release**:
- **v1.4.0-dev** (Completed): Core features polished (view modes, bulk operations)
- **v1.5.0-dev** (Current Release Candidate): Critical features complete (notifications, airing schedule, search)
- **v1.0.0 "Aoi (Ëëµ)"** (Official Release): Fully tested, polished, production-ready

### Post-Release (v1.1.0+)
Features that enhance the app but aren't critical for launch are documented in:
- üìÑ [POST_RELEASE_ROADMAP.md](./POST_RELEASE_ROADMAP.md) - Social features, AI companion, advanced analytics

### Architecture Decisions
- **Offline-first:** Local storage is the source of truth
- **Sync strategy:** Cloud sync is optional and respects user privacy
- **Conflict resolution:** Three-way merge with user choice
- **Error handling:** Graceful degradation, never lose user data

### Future Considerations
- **Backend migration:** Consider moving to dedicated backend (currently Supabase)
- **Real-time sync:** WebSocket support for instant updates
- **Desktop optimization:** Keyboard shortcuts, window management
- **Accessibility:** Screen reader support, high contrast themes
