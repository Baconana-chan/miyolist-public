# 🎌 Version Naming: "Aoi (葵)"

## What does "Aoi" mean?

**Aoi (葵)** is a Japanese word with multiple meanings:

1. **Blue/Azure** (青い) - The color of new beginnings and fresh starts
2. **Hollyhock** (葵) - A beautiful flower that symbolizes:
   - New beginnings
   - Ambition
   - Fruitfulness
   - Growth and prosperity

## Why "Aoi" for v1.0.0?

MiyoList v1.0.0 is the **official first release** after months of development. The name "Aoi" was chosen because:

- 🌸 **New Beginnings** - First stable release after dev versions
- 💙 **Blue Skies** - Clear path forward after development phase
- 🌱 **Growth** - From v1.1.0-dev to official v1.0.0
- ✨ **Fresh Start** - Transition from experimental to production-ready

## Version Naming Convention

Starting with v1.0.0, MiyoList uses **meaningful Japanese names** instead of standard semantic versioning for major releases:

### Release Versions
- **v1.0.0 "Aoi (葵)"** - Official release (Current target)
- **v2.0.0 "[TBD]"** - Next major version (future)

### Development Versions
- **v1.1.0-dev** through **v1.5.0-dev** - Pre-release builds
- Development versions use standard semantic versioning with `-dev` suffix

## Inspiration

The naming convention is inspired by:
- **Japanese culture** - Reflecting the manga-inspired UI design
- **Seasonal themes** - Future versions may use seasonal names
- **Meaningful symbolism** - Each name tells a story

## Future Version Names

Future releases will continue this tradition with Japanese names that reflect:
- The nature of the update (major feature, redesign, etc.)
- Seasonal themes (春 Spring, 夏 Summer, 秋 Autumn, 冬 Winter)
- Natural elements (風 Wind, 月 Moon, 星 Stars)
- Japanese aesthetics (侘寂 Wabi-sabi, 幽玄 Yūgen)
